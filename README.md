# hello-world

My name is Aurelie, also known as @aurelieBayre on Twitter and Free Code Camp.
I am French and currently live in Reims (140 km from Paris).

As of today (October 3rd), the advanced front-end section on Free Code Camp is in near sight! 4 more intermediate algorithm challenges to go. 
Looking forward to the advanced projects and then the front-end certification!

Part of the #100DaysofCode, I look forward to connect with other developers everyday. 

Feel welcome to reach out to me, especially if you're looking for a code-buddy on pair-programming projects. Or if you need encouragement. As a former teacher interested in well-being and self-actualization, I love helping people reach their full potential.
